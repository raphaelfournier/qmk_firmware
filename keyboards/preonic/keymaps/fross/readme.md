A French azerty layout for the Preonic, based on the FR-OSS layout.

The idea is to leave the computer in FR OSS layout (so that a traditionnal
French keyboard can be plugged in and used with the Preonic). The keycodes sent
give [this French layout][http://blog.guilou.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/screen-1628-815x262.png].
Left Alt is left of Left Win though.

The Raise and Lower layers have mapping for arrow keys, removed from the base
layer, on which the focus was to preserve the directly-accessible symbols.
The mapping is clearly not optimal at the moment, notably for programming, since
symbols are not paired (a known azerty problem). Opening brackets and
parenthesis are on the top row, while closing ones are on the bottom.
